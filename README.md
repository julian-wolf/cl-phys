cl-phys
=======

The cl-phys package attempts to make use of LISP's symbolic programming and powerful object system to simplify curve fitting and other routines that commonly arise in day-to-day physics.

Currently, it's build from the ground up, with no external dependencies. It is likely that this will change in the future, if and when development continues.
